# MicroGoal

A simple habit tracker that helps you achieve your long-term goals through daily micro-actions.

## About

MicroGoal (formerly Timeguard) helps you build positive habits and avoid negative ones by connecting your daily actions to your larger life goals. Unlike complex habit trackers, MicroGoal keeps it simple: define what you want to achieve, what you want to avoid, and track your daily progress with minimal friction.

## Features

### Goal Setting
- Define up to 3 Macro Goals (what you want to achieve)
- Define up to 3 Macro Anti-Goals (what you want to avoid)
- Create simple Micro Goals (daily habits) for each macro objective
- Set custom frequencies (daily, weekdays, weekends, or custom days)

### Daily Tracking
- Simple checklist of today's Micro Goals
- Quick toggle between complete/incomplete
- Streak tracking for consistent performance
- Optional daily reflection notes

### Progress Visualization
- XP system shows progress toward Macro Goals
- Weekly progress bars for at-a-glance feedback
- Streak counters for motivation
- Achievement celebrations for milestones

### Customization
- Goal templates for quick setup
- Color coding for different goal categories
- Personalized XP values for different activities
