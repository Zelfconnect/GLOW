# MicroGoal Cursor-Rules

## The 7-Step Process

For each implementation task in our [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md), follow these steps:

1. **SELECT**: Identify the next task from the implementation plan
2. **EXPLAIN**: Discuss the approach before writing any code
3. **IMPLEMENT**: Write the necessary code for just that task
4. **LOG**: Document what was changed with "IMPLEMENTED: [description]"
5. **TEST**: Verify the functionality works as expected
6. **CHECKMARK**: Mark task complete with "[✓]" and record "Checkpoint X passed" at phase milestones
7. **PROCEED**: Move to the next task

## Key Guidelines

- **One Task at a Time**: Complete and verify one task before moving to the next
- **Document Everything**: Keep the change log updated with each implementation
- **Regular Testing**: Test each component as it's built, not just at checkpoints
- **Clarity in Communication**: Always specify which task is being worked on
- **Checkpoint Verification**: Don't proceed to the next phase until checkpoint is confirmed

## Checkmarking Format

Use this format for marking tasks:
```
- [✓] Completed task
- [ ] Not yet completed task
```

## Progress Updates

After each implementation, update:
1. The task's status in implementation-plan.md
2. The Change Log section with what was implemented

## Common Phrase Templates

- "Working on: [task description]"
- "IMPLEMENTED: [what was changed or added]"
- "CHECKPOINT [X] PASSED: [summary of what's working]"
- "Moving to: [next task]"
